## Description
Oyster is an experimental implement of the Blocking Matching concept, designed specifically for compression artifacts removal.<br />
according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_artifact#Images), when performing block-based coding for quantization, several types of artifacts can appear.
- Ringing
- Contouring
- Posterizing
- Staircase noise
- Blockiness<br />
and oyster handles 3 of them, ringing, staircase noise and blockiness

## Requirements
- NNEDI3
- KNLMeansCL
- BM3D
- DFTTest
- FMTConv
- MVTools (floating point ver)

## Function List
- Super
- Basic
- Deringing
- Destaircase
- Deblocking

## Formats
- Bit Depth: 32bits floating point
- Color Space: Gray, RGB, YUV 4:4:4 (subsampled YUV formats are not supported)
- Scan Type: Progressive

## Notes
- **DO NOT** upsample your video to YUV 4:4:4 or RGB before processing if it's not natively full-sampled, just pass Y as a gray clip and merge the result with UV from the source clip, low-res chroma will jeopardize the correctness of weight calculation (fatal, especially to NLMeans).
- **DO NOT** crop your video before processing, it will destroy the macroblock boundary detecting.

## Details
### Super
Optional, it helps improve the precision of sub-pixel motion estimation and compensation, use it and get a quality boost or don't and get a performance boost
```python
Super (src, pel=4)
```
- src<br />
  clip to be processed
- pel<br />
  sub-pixel precision, could be 2 or 4, 2 = precision by half a pixel, 4 = precision by quarter a pixel.
