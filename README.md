## Description
Oyster is an experimental implement of the Blocking Matching concept, designed specifically for compression artifacts removal.<br />
according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_artifact#Images), when performing block-based coding for quantization, several types of artifacts can appear.
- Ringing
- Contouring
- Posterizing
- Staircase noise
- Blockiness

and oyster handles 3 of them, ringing, staircase noise and blockiness

## Requirements
- [NNEDI3](https://github.com/dubhater/vapoursynth-nnedi3)
- [KNLMeansCL](https://github.com/Khanattila/KNLMeansCL)
- [BM3D](https://github.com/HomeOfVapourSynthEvolution/VapourSynth-BM3D)
- [DFTTest](https://github.com/HomeOfVapourSynthEvolution/VapourSynth-DFTTest)
- [FMTConv](https://github.com/EleonoreMizo/fmtconv)
- [MVTools (floating point ver)](https://github.com/IFeelBloated/vapoursynth-mvtools-sf/tree/master)

## Function List
- Super
- Basic
- Deringing
- Destaircase
- Deblocking

## Formats
- Bit Depth: 32bits floating point
- Color Space: Gray, RGB, YUV 4:4:4 (subsampled YUV formats are not supported)
- Scan Type: Progressive

## Notes
- **DO NOT** upsample your video to YUV 4:4:4 or RGB before processing if it's not natively full-sampled, just pass Y as a gray clip and merge the result with UV from the source clip, low-res chroma will jeopardize the correctness of weight calculation (fatal, especially to NLMeans).
- **DO NOT** crop your video before processing, it will destroy the macroblock boundary detecting.

## Details
### Super
Optional, it helps improve the precision of sub-pixel motion estimation and compensation, use it and get a quality boost or don't and get a performance boost
```python
Super (src, pel=4)
```
- src<br />
  clip to be processed
- pel<br />
  sub-pixel precision, could be 2 or 4, 2 = precision by half a pixel, 4 = precision by quarter a pixel.

### Basic
The basic estimation does a wild block matching based motion compensation, it removes all significant artifacts and serves as the reference to all later specific artifacts removing functions
```python
Basic (src, super=None, radius=6, pel=4, sad_me=200.0, sad_mc=2000.0, scd1=10000.0, scd2=255.0)
```
- super<br />
  optional, clip generated by Oyster.Super
- radius<br />
  temporal radius, frames that fall in [current frame - radius, current frame + radius] will be referenced
- sad_me<br />
  SAD threshold of motion vector refining, see the MRecalculate chapter in MVTools doc for more details
- sad_mc<br />
  SAD threshold of temporal averaging, see the MDeGrain chapter in MVTools doc for more details
- scd1, scd2<br />
  scene change detection related parameters in MVTools, disable by default as such policy does not exist in BM3D and KNLMeansCL, manual cutting at scene change frames is preferred.
